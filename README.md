# town-visit

Example usage of scala Play, slick and AKKA streams in REST API. 

This projects implement simple REST service to calculate traveled distance between cities.
Each travel entry is stored in the database and user can call REST endpoint to find 
shortest traveled path in kilometers or days between visited cities.

## Prerequisites

1) Setup JDK and SBT
2) Install postgres and setup user with database
3) Create config file `app/config/application.conf` with DB credentials as following:
```
db.default {
  url = "jdbc:postgresql://127.0.0.1/mydb"
  username = "myuser"
  password = "mypassword"
}
```

## Usage

Run server on local:
```
sbt run
```

By default server will be started on:
```
http://localhost:9000
```

### Travels file

Before firs tun import TSV file with travels. File needs to contain lines with 
three columns separated by TAB character. Header is optional.

File syntax is similar to following:

#### File Format
* Date column - Time when city was visited in format "yyyy-mm-dd"
* City column - Name of the city
* Kilometers column - Traveled distance from last city, integer


#### Examples

```
Date	City	Kilometers
2019-05-01	Praha	0
2019-05-05	Beroun	32
2019-05-06	Praha	32
```

See [examples](./examples) folder with example files.

#### Travels generator

There is simple tool to generate example TSV files. City names are generated by 
randomly selected characters [A-Z]. Distance between cities is given from 
distance between each character in the set. There will be 24 visit in each day 
and visits are uniformly distributed.

It can be run from commandline using SBT ass following:

```
sbt "runMain utils.TravelsGenerator <file name> <file size> <name size>"
```

Parameters:
* File name - path to generated file, any existing file will be replaced
* File size - number of visits in file
* Name size - number of characters in randomly generated city name

Following command will generate 1000 visits with name like `AA`, `AD`, `QG`.

```
sbt "runMain utils.TravelsGenerator generated-travels.tsv 1000 2"
```

Tweak number of characters with file size. Too small number of characters 
on big file will result in dataset where all combinations of cities was visited 
consequently. Too big number of characters will create very small subsets.

## Testing

### Unit tests

Application unit tests can be run using SBT:

```
sbt test
```

Tests are using in memory H2 database to test DB queries.

### Performance tests

Performance tests are done using gatling. there is prepared simulation included in the 
project. It runs 10K users over 100s. Each user performs total 6 different requests for 
durations, distances and charts endpoints.

1) Start Play in production mode, by [staging the application](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.5.x/Deploying) and running the play script:
```
sbt stage
target/universal/stage/bin/town-visit -Dplay.http.secret.key=some-long-key-that-will-be-used-by-your-application
```

2) Import test travel to fresh database (only once). There is generated 10K 
sample for performance testing. If using custom file then you will need to change 
routes in gatlig spec.
```
curl -X POST  --data-binary "@examples/generated-travels-gatling-10K.tsv" http://localhost:9000/api/traveled/import
```

3) Run gatling using SBT 
```
sbt gatling:test
```

For best results, start the gatling load test up on another machine so you do not 
have contending resources.  

You can edit the [Gatling simulation](http://gatling.io/docs/2.2.2/general/simulation_structure.html#simulation-structure), 
and change the numbers as appropriate.

Once the test completes, you'll see an path to file with result charts.

#### Performance results

Following shows results for server and gatling running on single development laptop:

* Processor: i7-8550U
* Memory: 16 GB

System handled over 59K of total 60K requests in 100s for a database with 10K travel entries.

## Known problems

### DB import

1) For large datasets (more than 10M rows) takes long time to import. Import 
re-calculates distances from beginning and there is cartesian product in 
UPDATE statement. It would be better to import files and then do calculation 
in memory.

2) Only one import can run at a time. Concurrent imports will affect each other.


### Testing H2 database

1) There is shared H2 instance between tests. Each tests needs to clear database
otherwise tests can affect each other.

2) DB migrations are run for all test applications. This could become slow when
more tests are in place.

3) H2 can't emulate all postgres features. Re calculating data couldn't be tested 
using H2.
